In this project I implemented 3 classes called cards, die, and domino which simulates these games in code.

CARDS: A class for representing playing cards in a standard 52-card French deck.

DIE: A class to represent 6-sided dice with possibly non-standard numbering of the faces. A die has 6 faces with each face having an integer value.
A die has a current value that is equal to one of the face values (analogous to the uppermost face on a physical die). Rolling a die sets its current value to one of the face values chosen uniformly randomly.

DOMINO:A class that represents domino tiles. A domino is a rectangular tile with a line dividing its playing face into two sides.
Each side of the playing face is marked with pips (dots) similar to a standard 6-sided die. The number of pips on each side of the playing face ranges from Domino.MIN_VALUE to Domino.MAX_VALUE (inclusive).
In simpler terms, each domino tile has two integer values that range from Domino.MIN_VALUE to Domino.MAX_VALUE (inclusive).
