In this project I implemented 2 classes one called hounsfield and the other hounsfield window.

Hounsfield units are the units of measurement used in computed tomography (CT or CAT) scanning.
The Hounsfield scale is defined by specifying the radiodensity of air as -1000 Hounsfield units and the radiodensity of distilled water as 0 Hounsfield units.
Adjacent tissues in the human body can be distinguished from one another if their radiodensities differ

CT scanners for medical purposes typically restrict the value of reported Hounsfield units to integers in the range -1024 to 3071 so that a Hounsfield unit can be encoded as a 12-bit value.
This class uses the values -1024 and 3071 to represent the minimum and maximum, respectively, allowable Hounsfield unit values.

A Hounsfield window is defined by two values: (1) the window level, and (2) the window width. The window level is the Hounsfield unit value that the window is centered on.
The window width is the range of Hounsfield unit values that the window is focused on.

To test out the functionality of the hounsfield run the CTViewer program to visualize some CT-Scans 

***USE ECLIPSE EXECUTABLE TO RUN THE PROGRAM, GITHUB VIEWABLE IS JUST FOR CODE SHOW CASE***
