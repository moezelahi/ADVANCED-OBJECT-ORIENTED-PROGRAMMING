In this project we implemented 2 classes called complex and MandelbrotUtil.

Complex: A class for representing complex number arithmetic.

Mandelbrot: A simple program for drawing the Mandelbrot set. When run with the default settings the image is centered on the point (-0.5 + 0.0i), the length of the sides of the image is 2,
and the number of iterations to check if a point remains bounded (i.e., is in the Mandelbrot set) is 50.
These values can be changed using command line arguments: In eclipse, go to the Run menu, choose Run configurations, find the Mandelbrot Java application, and in the Arguments tab enter a new set of values (separated by spaces).
For example, enter the following four values to view Elephant Valley (view point (0.275 + 0.005i), side length 0.01, 200 iterations)


***USE ECLIPSE EXECUTABLE TO RUN THE PROGRAM, GITHUB VIEWABLE IS JUST FOR CODE SHOW CASE***
